Graph-talk
==========

Graph-talk is a library for structured data processing to solve tasks like parsing,
interpreting, or converting, in a simple and comprehensible for humans manner.

Library uses 3 key concepts to achieve the goal: a graph-like representation of
information and its processing; a dialogue-like communication between the model and
the process; a handler-event approach to recognize the input messages.
